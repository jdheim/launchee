# Welcome to Launchee

Launchee is a clean, minimalist dock for launching your essential shortcuts.

## How it works

1. Create a simple **YAML configuration file** that defines your shortcuts - each with a name, an icon, and an action.

2. Start Launchee - it reads the config and instantly displays a dock with your icons, ready to launch.

## Features

- **Run anything** - binaries, scripts, aliases, or commands with arguments.
- **Open the web fast** - launch your default browser with a specific URL in one click. Perfect for dashboards, docs, or quick links.
- **Simple configuration** - everything is defined in a clean, human-readable YAML file.
