## üíª Launchee

**Launchee** is a clean, minimalist dock for launching your essential shortcuts.

![Launchee](docs/static/img/launchee.gif)

#### Launch anything with a command

Tell Launchee what to run, and it opens instantly.
Point it at a binary, script, or alias, and you‚Äôre done.

#### Open the web right where you need it

Start your default browser with a specific URL in one click.
Jump straight into dashboards, docs, or any site without typing.

#### Simple YAML configuration

A clean YAML file powers everything.
Add a name, a path to icon, and a command (or URL) and it's live.
Easy to version, easy to share.
